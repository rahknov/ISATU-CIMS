  <div class="section rationale">
    <h2>ðŸ“Œ Rationale</h2>
    <p>The ISAT U institutions, theses, and capstone projects are a prerequisite to fulfill the academic requirements of the students on their educational journey. These documents are usually used to showcase the students' learning, research capabilities, and problem-solving ability. Each academic year, the institutions receive more than a hundred of these kinds of documents that need to be stored, classified, and monitored for their originality. This task is being handled by the university librarians, administrative personnel, and faculty. This kind of task is often prone to human error and consumes time. 
The most common challenge for this personnel in managing academic documents is duplication. It can be unintentional or a lack of access to the ongoing research and proposal. Students often propose a concept of research that is likely or very similar. In some cases, the research is nearly similar to the existing or ongoing theses and/or capstone projects. 
The current manual checking for the similarity of documents is inefficient for students who are conducting research proposals. Therefore, there is a need for an intelligent automated system that can classify and identify the content similarity of the research proposal from the existing and ongoing research nd alert the students or faculty to avoid duplication. By having this system, the students can be advised to discontinue or revise their research proposal.
By the use of natural language processing, machine learning, and semantic analysis through integration, this proposal aims to create a tool that can address both the duplication and classification that usually happen in the research proposal to uphold academic integrity and improve the quality of research across institutions.

    <h2>ðŸ“Œ Database Architecture</h2>
    <p>The 3-tier database architecture offers a robust, secure, 
      and scalable framework for the ISAT U intelligent 
      document analysis system. It improves 
      maintainability, safeguards academic data, 
      supports advanced research analysis, and delivers
       a better user experience, making it the ideal 
       choice for a growing educational institution 
       with evolving research management needs.

 <strong>researcher</strong>, <strong>document</strong>, <strong>analysis</strong>, and <strong>transaction_log</strong>. It ensures logical separation between users, their research, the analysis results, and all system activity logs.</p>
